# Arc'Link
Project for youCode 2025 Submission

Arc'Link is a progressive web application to connect members of the Arc'teryx community in a safe, protected environment. 

## 🌟 Inspiration
We believe the outdoors should belong to everyone — not just those who can afford the gear or grew up near the mountains.  
The most powerful movements often begin with a story: a hike that changed someone’s life, a community that built a trail together, a barrier broken by pure determination.

**Arc'Link** was born to bring those stories together — connecting the dreamers, doers, and disruptors funded by Arc'teryx.  
This isn’t just a platform. It’s a digital campfire — a space where changemakers find each other and spark the next adventure.


## 🔧 What It Does
Arc'Link is a web platform where Arc'teryx grantees can:
- Share personal stories and project updates
- Create and browse community events
- Find collaborators, volunteers, and mentors
- Offer or request support and resources


## 🛠️ How We Built It
- **Frontend**: React, styled with TailwindCSS and icons from Lucide React for a clean, smooth UI
- **Backend**: Next.js, Firebase Authentication for secure user login, and Firestore for real-time data syncing

## 🚧 Challenges We Ran Into
- **Real-time updates**: Ensuring smooth syncing of posts and events across users with Firebase required careful data structuring.
- **Scope creep**: We had many feature ideas but prioritized what would have the biggest impact within the time constraints.

## 🌟 Accomplishments We're Proud Of
- Built a fully functional prototype with authentication, event creation, and a live activity feed
- Designed a clean, inclusive user interface that reflects Arc'teryx community values
- Focused on accessibility and community trust from the start


## 🔍 What We Learned
- How to rapidly prototype a full-stack application with real-world utility
- The importance of inclusive design—not just visually, but in how we structure interactions
- How to channel a broad social mission into a focused, actionable product

## 🚀 What's Next for Arc'Link
- **User testing**: Pilot with real Arc'teryx grantees to gather feedback and improve the platform
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Optimize for smaller devices for easier field use
- **Points & recognition system**: Reward users for collaboration, event hosting, and support
- **Admin tools**: Enable Arc'teryx staff to spotlight projects, manage events, and collect insights

> ✨ _Arc'Link is more than a project — it's a movement to empower every outdoor storyteller, builder, and changemaker._
